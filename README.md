Disables adds by creating a different youtube. 

SECURITY CANNOT BE ENSURED. 

Though no data is collected, the site is only under the security preview of https. no other security concerns have been factored in. 

# usage
There are currently 3 commands availible to users: search, channel, and vidNum;
Search is the default command. It calles youtube's search function. 

/channel this searches channels by name and displays all the videos on a channel (limited by maxVids.txt)

# for ben for stuff to do
Basically, I have the main code to create the page done. The changes would include making a better html format that gets hardcodede into the java code. In addition if you created a css file that could be linked to the java doc. 

The index html outside the html folder is the template. Changes are made there for experimental purposes, and then the actual changes are made in the code itself.
