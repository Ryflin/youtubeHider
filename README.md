SECURITY CANNOT BE ENSURED. 

Though no data is collected, the site is only under the security preview of https. no other security concerns have been factored in. 

# usage
There are currently 3 commands availible to users: search, channel, and vidNum;

/vidNum allows the user to change the maximum number of videos displayed per page
